We'll send our Linuxpractices folder from linux machine to
gitHub remote repository. In order to send this folder,
we have to initialize the git on the LinuxPractices folder.
We should use git add command for sending for adding the files we want on a git
staging area. Staging area is still are on local area.WE can say that git staging is in between remote and local.
Before we send all the codes in github remote repository, we should message to the files so that we can know the 
purpose of the files. Then we can create a main branch on the github, then add our credentials, and send it.
Git status will help us to see what files can be added to next commit. Or which files are different can be pushed to github.
